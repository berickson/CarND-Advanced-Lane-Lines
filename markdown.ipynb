    "See the class \"Camera\" in the notebook \"./Advanced Lane Lines.ipynb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibrate method in the camera class first creates object points for all supplied chessboard corner images.  I refine the corners by calling the cv2.cornerSubPix method.  `all_image_points` contains all the corners from the images, and 'all_object_points' contains idealized coordinates from the chessboard. I then used the output `all_object_points` and `all_image_points` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I  applied this distortion correction to first calibration  image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

I actually did this after the un-distort step so that my code could concentrate on the lane itself and utilize an image that was completely filled with lane. I find the pixel with 99th percentile intensity and use that as the cut-off.  Since each pictures contains a relatively constant percentage of lane lines when viewed in birds-eye, this worked well.\n",

I found the src coordinates of the transform by carefully selecting pixel locations at the edges of images with straight lane lines.  I selected dst coordinates by selecting a coordinates that would fill the image with the desired lane and a road on the side, but not include other lanes or points too near the vanishing point where the lane lines are too small to reliably detect.\n",

Because lane lines are mostly vertical in the birds-eye view, I applied the Sobel in the horizontal direction (dx=1,dy=0).  This will emphasize vertical lines.  I chose a relatively large kernel size of 21 so that edged would be found for the large lane line features but not for smaller road features like road texture.\n",
